    <h2>Teaching Experience and the Feedback</h2>
    <p>I hold a strong commitment to teaching excellence. At CUHK, I served as a teaching assistant for three courses. I was praised for simplifying complex quantitative methods and fostering student engagement. For instance, a student commented:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Thank you, Howard, for teaching the quantitative methods and providing clear guidelines. He has been a very supportive tutor and one of the best tutors I have ever encountered.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Students must work hard, which in turn pushes teachers to share more knowledge.</strong> (Prof. Lianjiang LI's teaching motto)</li>
      <li><strong>Always stay open.</strong> (Prof. Xi CHEN's teaching motto)</li>
      <li><strong>Always keep learning new and challenging things.</strong> (Prof. Hai LIANG's teaching motto)</li>
    
      <li><strong>Methods are weapons.</strong></li>
      
      <li><strong>The essence of teaching is to pass on responsibility.</strong> This responsibility comes from the inspiration received from my teachers when I was a student and the duties entrusted to teachers by society.</li>
      <li><strong>Only by understanding something yourself can you truly teach it to your students.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Computational Social Science Course</h2>
    <p>I am interested in teaching a computational social science course. I have preliminarily designed a course titled <strong>“Computational Social Science: Introduction and Application.”</strong> It covers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>R/Python basics</li>
      <li>Web scraping</li>
      <li>Machine learning (e.g., topic modeling and supervised learning)</li>
      <li>Social network analysis</li>
      <li>Image-as-data</li>
      <li>Audio/video analysis</li>
      <li>How Computational Social Science contributes to traditional methods (e.g., survey approach) </li>
      <li>And other related topics</li>
    </ul>
